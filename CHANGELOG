Version 1.2, 2006-01-23
-----------------------

- Improved support for files with CRLF-based line endings, fixing a common
  reported problem stating "assertion error: assert line == "%%EOF"".

- Software author/maintainer is now officially a proud married person, which
  is sure to result in better software... somehow.


Version 1.1, 2006-01-18
-----------------------

- Add capability to rotate pages.

- Improved PDF reading support to properly manage inherited attributes from
  /Type=/Pages nodes.  This means that page groups that are rotated or have
  different media boxes or whatever will now work properly.

- Added PDF 1.5 support.  Namely cross-reference streams and object streams.
  This release can mangle Adobe's PDFReference16.pdf successfully.


Version 1.0, 2006-01-17
-----------------------

- First distutils-capable true public release.  Supports a wide variety of PDF
  files that I found sitting around on my system.

- Does not support some PDF 1.5 features, such as object streams,
  cross-reference streams.
