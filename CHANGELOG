Version 1.1, 2006-01-18
-----------------------

- Add capability to rotate pages.

- Improved PDF reading support to properly manage inherited attributes from
  /Type=/Pages nodes.  This means that page groups that are rotated or have
  different media boxes or whatever will now work properly.

- Added PDF 1.5 support.  Namely cross-reference streams and object streams.
  This release can mangle Adobe's PDFReference16.pdf successfully.


Version 1.0, 2006-01-17
-----------------------

- First distutils-capable true public release.  Supports a wide variety of PDF
  files that I found sitting around on my system.

- Does not support some PDF 1.5 features, such as object streams,
  cross-reference streams.
